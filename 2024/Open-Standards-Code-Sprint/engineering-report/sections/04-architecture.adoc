== High-Level Architecture

As illustrated in <<img_architecture>>, the sprint architecture was designed to enable client applications to connect to different servers that implement a variety of standards. The architecture also included several different software libraries that support open geospatial standards and enable the extraction, transformation, and loading of geospatial data. The participants deployed the their software in their own infrastructure.
