==== DGGS-JSON and DGGS-UBJSON

The https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-038.html#rc_data-json[DGGS-JSON] and https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-038.html#rc_data-ubjson[DGGS-UBJSON] (based on https://ubjson.org/[Universal Binary JSON])
formats, defined as part of requirement classes for OGC API - DGGS, provide a compact and efficient way to retrieve data quantized to a particular Discrete Global Grid Reference System (DGGRS).
By leveraging a shared knowledge of the DGGRS between the client and server (or the producer and consumer in the case of an offline file), the large majority of the payload
is simply the data values associated with each sub-zone at a given relative depth of the parent zone for which data is being encoded.
A fixed deterministic sub-zone order needs to be defined as part of the DGGRS in order to enable this.

A draft https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-discrete-global-grid-systems/blob/master/core/schemas/dggs-json/dggs-json.json[JSON schema] for DGGS-JSON is available.
