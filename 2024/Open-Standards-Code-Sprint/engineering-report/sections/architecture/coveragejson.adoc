==== OGC CoverageJSON

CoverageJSON is a format for encoding coverage data such as grids, time series, and vertical profiles, each distinguished by the geometry of their spatiotemporal domain. A CoverageJSON document is serialized in JavaScipt Object Notation (JSON). A CoverageJSON object represents a domain, a range, a coverage, or a collection of coverages. A range in CoverageJSON represents coverage values. A coverage in CoverageJSON is the combination of a domain, parameters, ranges, and additional metadata. A coverage collection represents a list of coverages.
