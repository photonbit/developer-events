==== QGIS

QGIS is a free and open-source cross-platform desktop GIS that supports viewing, editing, and analysis of geospatial data. The https://www.qgis.org/[QGIS] stable release V3.28.6-Firenze, and later versions, has a Time Slider/Controller added to the menu bar. It behaves like a video controller if relevant to the data being displayed. This and https://www.qgis.org/download/[later versions] also support the https://ogcapi.ogc.org/edr/[OGC API-EDR] queries via a plugin.

Release V3.37 and https://www.qgis.org/download/[later] now supports a Vertical Slider for data and layers that have a vertical extent.

==== Status of OGCAPI SourceType support in QGIS 

QGIS supports adding a Raster or Vector Layer, using an `OGC API` Source Type. 
Under the hood, QGIS uses the https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/ogcapi.html[OGCAPI] GDAL driver. 
During this code sprint, this functionality was tested for different OGC APIs, in order to figure out what is working and to try to understand if the issue is on GDAL or QGIS.

An issue with relative links was identified on GDAL, which was affecting all the APIs. The issue was already fixed and is described https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogcna-auto-review/24-034.html#_gdal[here].

The current status (using QGIS version 3.39.0-Master QGIS code revision 399f7df1c7 and GDAL/OGR version 3.10.0dev-126a88523a) is:

* OGC API - Features is not working as expected, as described on this https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/58087[issue].
* OGC API - Tiles (vector) is not working, as described on this https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/58174[issue].
* OGC API - Tiles (raster) is working.
* OGC API - Maps is working.
* OGC API - Coverages is working.
