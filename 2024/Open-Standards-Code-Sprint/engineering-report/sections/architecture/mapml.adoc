==== MapML

===== Introduction

Map Markup Language (MapML) is a text-based format which enables web page authors to insert maps into web pages as hypertext documents exchanged over HTTP. One of the well known implementations of MapML is the open source GeoServer software product, which provides access to MapML through WMS, WMTS and WFS so far. Through this code sprint, the MapML community sought to tackle integration of MapML into OGC APIs and potentially to demonstrate both the serving of MapML documents through such APIs and the accessing of content encoded as MapML. Experimenting with the implementation of MapML in OGC APIs is important because of the need to obtain feedback from the developer community and because MapML is a proposal to the browser community from the spatial community for natively integrating maps into web pages. In order to make that case to the browser community, there is a need to have the widest possible review and feedback from the geospatial community. 

Across society, HTML plays a key role on the Web.  Maps are therefore important enough to fit into web browsers because maps play a key role in how location is communicated across society. So on the day that browsers handle maps natively the same way that they handle images, there should be a wealth of content waiting to be displayed on the possibly billions of web pages that will display location information. Thus, integrating MapML support into geospatial content management systems that are fronted by implementations of OGC Web Service Standards and OGC API Standards will be essential and so the OGC community and the MapML viewer polyfill are key to meeting that goal. 

===== Structure

The MapML viewer is a media-like widget that can be controlled with attributes like other forms of media that can be embedded in a web page. The Map content is represented by the layer element and it comes in two flavors, _inline_ and _remote_, shown in <<mapml_structure>> on the left and right respectively. Inline content is interactive and has a Document Object Model (DOM) footprint in the web browser. In contrast, remote content can be identified by the fact that the layer has a source `src` attribute pointing to a remote web service or OGC API. Remote content is essential to enabling mashups of ad hoc content from around the Web, and would be provided by OGC APIs directly.

Inline content in MapML comes in the form of `map-extent`, `map-feature`, `map-tile` elements, as well as various forms of metadata, and all inline content is encoded according to the HTML syntax parser rules within `layer-` elements. Remote content is loaded via content fetched from the `layer- src` attribute, and is encoded in the XHTML namespace, and because XML parsing rules apply, it is naturally more rigid. However because it is XHTML, it can be readily incorporated into HTML pages. 

Map extents (`map-extent` elements) represent templated tiled, feature, or image map content that is repeatedly fetched as needed, based on movement of the map viewer. Map features are of course OGC Simple Features and tiles are either feature- or image-based. Geospatial data can be viewed in a web page as one or more maps on the document canvas in a single or multi page web application, by using the MapML viewer element as many times as needed. 

The viewer is conceptually like the video or audio element. It has a set of built-in controls that are exemplified in <<mapml_viewer>>, and they can be turned on or off as a group or individually. The default controls are keyboard accessible and are navigable with Tab and Shift+Tab keys. The default controls are not styleable, so if custom controls are needed, then a developer has to create their own. That is why the controls are toggleable.

===== Layers

In MapML, a map can have zero or more layers and for map layers fewer is oftentimes better, because a map can get very visually cluttered if it has too many layers. Layers are exposed to the user through the layer control in DOM order, from the closest to document start to the furthest. MapML documents are parsed in sequence based on 'distance' from the document start. Layers and layer content is rendered according to the 'painters model'. Layers contain a single level of node depth; there cannot be recursively or infinitely nested layers or layer content.  

===== Map Extents

A map extent (`map-extent` element) is a templated form of map content that allows the map author to fetch features, tiles or whole-map image content on demand (from a web service or API) based on map movement. The fetched content overlays and potentially obscures previously rendered content (per the painter's model). Consequently, each `map-extent` is exposed in the layer control underneath the parent layer as part of that layer's settings menu item, in which it is labeled (by default) as a 'Sub-layer' (the default accessible name) which can be progressively turned on or off by the user, whereas individual features are not exposed individually in the layer control. If control of individual features is needed, those features need to be wrapped in a layer of their own. Layers can contain feature collections. Features on a map are a single tab stop, but are keyboard navigable via the arrow keys.

===== Coordinate Reference Systems

MapML supports different map tiling schemes through a concept called the Tiled Coordinate Reference System (TCRS) A TCRS is a set of associated coordinate systems (some of) which share a common origin in space, but which differ by the size of their smallest unit at defined locations, e.g. meters/pixel along the equator (<<MapML>>). A TCRS binds an instance of a Coordinate Reference System with an instance of a Tile Matrix Set into a single well known value of `projection`, and it places axis order constraints on content encoded according to that TCRS (as do all CRS). Specifically, coordinates when not explicitly marked up, are required to be encoded with horizontal axis followed by vertical axis ("xy" order). An example of how the TCRS may be handled can be observed in GeoServer which defines the "MapML:" CRS authority for the pre-defined MapML projection values (i.e. MapML:OSMTILE, MapML:CBMTILE, MapML:WGS84 and MapML:APSTILE) in which the association between the tile matrix set and the coordinate reference system of the given TCRS is managed internally. Using this authority prefix allows GeoServer to enable MapML access through the strict OGC web service interface standards, and a similar technique may be applicable in the OGC API implementations. There are the four well known or proof of concept TCRS defined by the MapML specification (most importantly: OSMTILE, WGS84, and CBMTILE), and web developers can define custom TCRS for use in the MapML viewer, using the proj4.js library. OGC API implementations might be able to adapt the GeoServer technique of defining the "MapML:" CRS authority for OGC API-based interfaces where an official spatial reference system name is a required information item, and in doing so, to not rely on unwritten semantics which commonly happens in geospatial information exchange.
