==== ISO 19157-3 Data Quality Measures Register

Concepts around data quality have evolved over the past 20 or so years with the advent and proliferation of open sourced, non-authoritative data sources. Standards such as ISO 19115 Geospatial Metadata and ISO 19157 Geospatial Data Quality have been used and incorporated into metadata profiles to record the quality of geospatial datasets. One of the grounding concepts within the ISO standards is the _universe of discourse_ which is poorly translated to _ground truth_ or _real world_. In the early days of ISO concepts of data quality, the universe of discourse was much more simple to determine because the authoritative datasets were routinely ground truthed for accuracy. A salient example of this is aerial photography where flight paths were planned and a ground crew would lay out tie points on the ground to be captured by the imagery. Distances then could be physically measured to create an overall positional accuracy for the image. In the modern world of non-authoritative, crowdsourced or open source data, the _universe of discourse_ concept does not apply in the same way. The data quality model reports on concepts such as:

* Completeness - the number or percentage of features that appear within the dataset compared to the universe of discourse.
* Thematic Accuracy - the number or percentage of misclassified features.
* Logical Consistency - the number of missing links in a road dataset.
* Conceptual Consistency - number of overlapping surfaces in a dataset.

To facilitate dataset comparisons, there is a need for evaluations and data quality reports (metadata or a quality evaluation report) to be expressed in a comparable way. Furthermore, it is necessary to have a common understanding of the data quality measures that have been used. An example of such common understanding of a standard quality measure is defined in ISO 19157-1:2023 Geographic information - Data quality - Part 1: General requirements (<<ISO19157-1>>). This standard defines the structure of a data quality measure as well as all additional attributes describing a data quality measure - see in <<img-dqm>>.

To comply with current best practice for sharing data over the web, these measures have to reside in a machine-actionable data quality measures register. Such a register is currently under development at ISO/TC211 and OGC. ISO 19157-3 Geographic information - Data quality - Part 3: Data quality measures register will be the standard defining the components and content structure of a register for data quality measures, and the registration and maintenance procedure (<<bib_iso19157_3>>). All of this is in compliance with ISO 19135 Geographic information - Registration and registration procedures, a governing standard for all ISO/TC211 registers (<<ISO19135-1>>). The measures will be published through the ISO 19157-3 register which will be hosted at OGC, the Registration Authority of ISO 19157-3. OGC will host the ISO 19157-3 register on OGC RAINBOW, a registry of terms and definitions. The full version of the ISO 19157-3 Data Quality measures register is expected to be published together with the ISO 19157-3 standard in early 2026.
