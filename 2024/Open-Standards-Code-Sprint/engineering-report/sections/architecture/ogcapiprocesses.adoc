==== OGC API - Processes

The https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes[OGC API - Processes] Standard supports the wrapping of computational tasks into executable processes that can be offered by a server through a Web API and be invoked by a client application (<<OGC18-062r2>>). The Standard enables the execution of computing processes and the retrieval of metadata describing the purpose and functionality of the processes. Typically, these processes execute well-defined algorithms that ingest vector and/or coverage data to produce new datasets. 

The https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-044.html[OGC API — Processes — Part 2: Deploy, Replace, Undeploy] candidate Standard extends the core capabilities specified in the OGC API — Processes — Part 1: Core (<<OGC18-062r2>>) with the ability to dynamically add, modify and/or delete individual processes using an implementation (endpoint) of the OGC API — Processes Standard.
