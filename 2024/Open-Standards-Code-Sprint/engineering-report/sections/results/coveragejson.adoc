==== OGC CoverageJSON

CoverageJSON maintainers participated in the code sprint with a focus on identifying potential avenues for enhancing the CoverageJSON ecosystem. The code sprint offered a useful forum for discussion and experimentation across various working groups. Therefore, where one solution was found to be useful for one standard, there was a high likelihood that the same solution (or a modification of it) could be useful to another. 

Some of the potential opportunities for CoverageJSON identified during the code sprint included:

* Registration of a media type application/cov+json with Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). 
* Migration from an OGC Community Standard to a full OGC Standard. 
* Improvement of the CoverageJSON ecosystem through GDAL and STAC Browser support, as well as through implementation of a Python-based validator.
* Addition of CoverageJSON to the OGC Developer Website.
