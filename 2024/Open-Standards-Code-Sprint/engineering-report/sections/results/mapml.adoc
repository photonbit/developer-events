==== MapML

Several participants worked on this MapML track.

===== pygeoapi

Pygeoapi was used as the base for a prototype web application that is able to serve MapML remote content.

The original goal was to add MapML support by leveraging pygeoapi's plugin framework. However, after inspection of the code this proved to not be possible - proper integration of MapML would require modifications to the core pygeoapi code, something which was deemed out of scope for the code sprint. As such, development efforts consisted of developing a thin wrapper around pygeoapi which would add the relevant bits of MapML-related code while still keeping pygeoapi as the main agent. This approach worked out well.

The prototype thus consisted of two-components:

- A pygeoapi plugin that defined a tile-based data provider which knew how to respond to requests with
the `Accept:text/mapml` header

- A small middleware for pygeoapi's Flask application which intercepted relevant requests and performed post-processing of the pygeoapi response in order to add support for MapML

In order to test the results, a simple web-based client was also implemented as a separate application. This web client featured the `+<mapml-viewer>+` element and configured remote layers that were being fetched from our prototype.


====== pygeoapi MapML tile provider plugin

Taking advantage of pygeoapi's extensibility the existing tile provider was subclassed in order to add support for responding with a MapML document to requests for tileset metadata. In the context of the code sprint, support was restricted to the `+WebMercatorQuad+` tileset. A sample request would be:

.Request
----
GET /collections/{collection-id}/tiles/WebMercatorQuad "Accept:text/mapml"
----

The custom tile provider was implemented as to recognize the MapML media type being requested in the request's `+Accept+` header and to generate a suitable MapML document as the response. This allowed the pygeoapi-based prototype to serve as a server for OGC API Tiles, which generic clients would be able to use for requesting MapML data. The server thus generated a response like:

====== pygeoapi wrapper code

The pygeoapi wrapper code, which was implemented as a https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/api/#flask.Flask.after_request[Flask after_request()] callback, dealt with adding support for the `+text/mapml+` media type for some endpoints and mostly with converting features encoded in `+GeoJSON+` to their respective `+MapML+` representations, thus making it possible to have support for remote `MapML` features.

====== Simple MapML web client

In order to test how the pygeoapi-based prototype worked as a server of remote MapML data, a small web client was implemented, making use of the https://www.npmjs.com/package/@maps4html/web-map-custom-element[@maps4html/web-map-custom-element] javascript library, which emulates support for MapML in the browser.

The client asked for a couple of remote layers, being served by the pygeoapi-based prototype application. One of these remote layers served image tiles, while the other served MapML features.

===== CREAF Miramon

UAB-CREAF participated in the sprint by contributing their MiraMon Map Server. This application was adapted to OGC API Maps and Tiles during previous sprints. The OGC API Maps allow for requesting a map of a collection. If the request is done to this endpoint `/collections/{collectionId}/map` with no parameters, the server is free to respond with a "nice" map that represents the collection or a representative area of it. If the negotiated media type is static, the selection of the area is particularly important. In the case of MapML, the map is interactive, giving freedom to the user to correct the server decision by panning and zooming. In this particular sprint, two modifications were introduced in the MiraMon Map Server to include MapML support.

* A request to a `/collections/{collectionId}/map` with no extra parameters that negotiates HTML and results in the creation of an HTML page that includes some metadata about the collection and a MapML section to show the interactive map. This web page can be visualized in the map browser with the help of MapML common JavaScript libraries.
* A request to a `/collections/{collectionId}/map` with no extra parameters that negotiates MapML, and results in a MapML document that can be visualized in Chrome if an specific add-in has been previously setup.

image::images/HTMLwithMapML.png[width=800,align="center"]

In both cases the MiraMon Map Server implementing OGC API - Maps is used twice:

* It produces the initial response to the "minimalistic" map request (with no parameters) asking for  the HTML or MapML representation of the collection.
* The MapML content uses the URL template mechanism to get an image map (in this case a PNG) of the current view and the subsequent views that the user will generate by panning and zooming into the map.

The following code is common to both MapML responses (HTML or MapML versions). Please note that the OGC API - Maps is used to generate the PNGs maps. The HTML element `map-link` contains a link to a URL template that once "resolved" with the right `map-input` values become a call that conforms to the OGC API maps. This demonstrates that the current specification of MapML can use the new OGC API Maps with no modification.

In case the API implementation supports MapML, it is convenient that the collection description page advertises a link to the map. The following figure illustrates how this looks like in the HTML representation of the response.

===== GNOSIS Map Server

The official MapML client was tested with outputs from OGC API endpoints of the GNOSIS Map Server for multiple access mechanisms: OGC API - Maps, OGC API - Features and OGC API - Tiles (for both map tiles and vector tiles).

An https://maps.gnosis.earth/mapml.html[HTML page] was set up to demonstrate these capabilities, where the user can toggle the visibility of a map, map tiles, vector features and vector tiles.

For the features and vector tiles experiments, the client accessed a MapML representation of the vector tiles and features, including their geometry,
which was previously implemented in the GNOSIS Map Server for https://docs.ogc.org/per/19-046r1.html[OGC Testbed 15].

image::images/mapml-gnosis-vector-and-map-tiles.png[width=700,align="center"]

Some rendering issues were noticed in the client with the vector features and vector tiles, with the vector tiles issues more significant.
This is possibly caused by invalid geometry generated by the server, issues on the client side, or a combination of both.
These issues should be investigated further and addressed.

image::images/mapml-gnosis-features-artifacts.png[width=700,align="center"]

A future version of the GNOSIS Map Server could support a MapML representation of the `/map` endpoint which automatically set up the MapML elements for the different layers available at that end-point.
This representation would need to choose between the different possible access mechanisms, or offer all of them while only making one visible by default, allowing the user to access the same data in different ways.

===== Experimentation by Rui Cavaco

mailto:rpcavaco@gmail.com[Rui Cavaco]'s work (in person at code sprint) had three different 'tracks':

* get a more complete understanding of the MapML concept, experimenting with reference implementation polyfill examples;
* experimenting with JavaScript, possibly extending some polyfill's functionality;
* understand polyfill support to projected CRS's such as 'national grids'.

At first, it was clear that MapML itself, and the reference implementation polyfill, show several capabilities which manifest themselves when one goes beyond the simplest OSM tiling examples.

Three examples of this:

* the map-extent element (and the possibility of there existing several for each layer);
* the combining of the “projection” attribute and of “units” attribute;
* the OSMTILES, CBTILES and other keywords for “projection” or “units”.

The necessity to go through several examples to fully grasp the MapML capability became very clear.

Also became quite clear that it is not crucial to extend polyfill's functionality, since it is supposed that such functionality should be, sooner or later, transferred to browser's code bases.

So Rui Cavaco's final work in the code sprint was focused on JavaScript DOM manipulation using, one of MapML's most interesting features: the ability to, easily, add dynamic changes to web maps. In this case, a real world problem was addressed, the ability to add to and remove from, a web map, at user's request, some municipal-scale themes from Northern Portugal region.

To this purpose a webapp was built using MapML polyfill from https://github.com/Maps4HTML/Web-Map-Custom-Element[Maps4HTML] and https://panel.holoviz.org/[Holoviz Panel] Python web framework.
