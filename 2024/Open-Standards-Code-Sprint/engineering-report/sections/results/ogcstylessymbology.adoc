==== OGC Styles and Symbology

During this code sprint, the sprint participants worked on drafting the OGC Styles & Symbology candidate standard. The work included:

* discussing possible link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/issues/24#issuecomment-2222335333[use cases] for `hatch`, `stipple` & `pattern` fills,
* addition of a `Metadata` section in the link:https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html#rc-core[Requirements Class "Core"] with `keywords` and `geoDataClasses` parameters in line with the JSON schema,
* discussion and clarification of the concepts of link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/issues/64[Stipples] and link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/issues/59[Hatches],
* drafting requirements with portrayal examples,
* creating placeholders for the Abstract Test Suite,
* discussion and clarification of `viz.pass`, `feature.pass` and `zOrder` concepts,
* a discussion also took place on consistency of UML class diagrams (see link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/issues/74[#74]),
* work on a future link:https://github.com/maxcollombin/CartoSymTranscoder[CartoSym transcoder],
* discussion with Tom Kralidis on the possibility of implementing OGC API - Styles in pygeoapi based on the `GetStyles` operation of a `WMS` service,
* discussion with Gobe Hobona on the relevance of using link:https://sparxsystems.com/products/ea/[Enterprise Architect] for UML modelling,
* work on updating the SWG charter, clarifying the work items for Cartographic Symbology 2.0 parts 1-4, and proposing to rename the SWG to "Cartographic Symbology" to align with the name of the standard as well as
the "CartoSym" encodings, and avoiding confusion with the scope of the _OGC API - Styles_ SWG.

A number of GitHub link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/issues?q=label%3A%222024-07+Sprint%22[issues] were created as a result of this work. This included:

* link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/issues/24[#24]: Custom fill

===== Styles and Symbology Conclusions

The code sprint enabled the editors of the OGC Cartographic Symbology candidate standard to work together on drafting the standard.
They were able to clarify some concepts, requirements and use cases and moved the standard forward. A number of important tasks remain to be completed before CartoSym 2.0 - Part 1 can be finalized.

These tasks include:

* detailing the requirements, including examples of rendering with the corresponding link:https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html#rc-cscss[CartoSym-CSS encoding] examples in the Requirements Classes
and appendix B: link:https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html#annex-sldse[Mapping of SLD/SE and notable vendor extensions to the Conceptual Model]
* update the UML class diagrams (see link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/issues/74[#74]),
* writing the Annex A: "Abstract Test Suite (Normative)" as already started link:https://github.com/maxcollombin/styles-and-symbology/tree/ats[here],
* implementing transcoders and rendering engines,
* define a global UML class hierarchy diagram covering all of the Requirements Classes. Enterprise Architect could be a useful tool for this. It would also enable the SWG to generate an XSD schema and a JSON schema so that we can
check the consistency of the existing schema. The UML to JSON conversion tool link:https://github.com/maykinmedia/imvertor-lite[imvertor-lite] could also be considered,
* check that the JSON schema complies with the candidate link:https://github.com/Geonovum/uml2json[Best Practice for OGC - UML to JSON Encoding Rules].
