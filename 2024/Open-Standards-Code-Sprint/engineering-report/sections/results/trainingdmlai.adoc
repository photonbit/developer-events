==== Training Data Markup Language for Artificial Intelligence

At the time of the code sprint, the Training Data Markup Language for Artificial Intelligence (TrainingDML-AI) Conceptual Model was a fully approved OGC Standard. However, both the JSON and XML encodings of TrainingDML-AI were still candidate Standards. Therefore, several of the code sprint activities involved TrainingDML-AI data encodings. Furthermore, the TrainingDML-AI Standard was the focus of a mentoring session.

Another sprint activity involved configuring a training dataset as a pygeometa metadata control file and generating TrainingDataML-AI metadata from pygeometa. A more detailed description of the pygeometa activities is documented at <<results_pygeometa>>. This capability potentially makes it possible to conduct Extract-Transform-Load operations between other metadata formats supported by pygeometa and the JSON encoding on TrainingDML.

The feedback provided by sprint participants also enabled the SWG members from Wuhan University (WHU) to fix issues encountered in example files for the candidate Standard. Furthermore, the SWG members also participated in the discussions and supported the implementations by fellow sprint participants, which included:

** Pixalytics Ltd (Sam Lavender) worked on updating their implementation, using the https://github.com/openrsgis/pytdml[pytdml] Python library. Problems were faced with recent updates to the library and so an https://github.com/openrsgis/pytdml/issues/11[issue] was raised.
** TEAM Engine maintainers from OGC Staff worked on an Executable Test Suite (ETS) which will be integrated into OGC's compliance testing tools, in the future, to provide compliance testing of TrainingDML-AI datasets. A screenshot of TEAM Engine is shown in <<img_teamengine>>.
