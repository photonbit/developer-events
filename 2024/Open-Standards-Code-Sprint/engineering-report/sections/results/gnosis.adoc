==== GNOSIS Map Server

New capabilities were integrated in the GNOSIS Map Server during the code sprint, including support for CQL2 advanced spatial operators and WKT geometry,
support for filtering map and coverage requests by geometry using CQL2 expressions including WKT geometry, as well as support for the <<dggs-json,DGGS-JSON>> data encoding
and additional improvements to the implementation of OGC API - DGGS.

[[gnosis-dggsjson]]
In order to support output of DGGS-JSON data, a deterministic ordering of sub-zones needs to be implemented.
Progress on the initial design of this scanline based ordering was made at the https://developer.ogc.org/sprints/23/[previous code sprint in Evora], with progress on the implementation since then.
During the code sprint, this initial support was deployed.

In addition to the ordering of sub-zones for polar pentagonal zones which was not yet implemented, issues were noticed with parent hexagonal zones crossing interruptions of the
Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area planar projection. These issues were identified as new variations of problem which need to be taken into account by the sub-zone ordering algorithm,
and work was undertaken to implement these cases correctly. Progress was also made on figuring out the correct sub-zone order of polar pentagonal parent zones.

A snippet extract of the DGGS-JSON file used to render this data follows, with the full version available from the OGC API - DGGS implementation at https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/gebco/dggs/ISEA3H/zones/B2-1-A/data.json?zone-depth=7.
The snippet illustrates how the bulk of the encoded data is a simple linearized one-dimensional array of the values associated with each zone, implying a particular order.
There is no need to provide the coordinates of the zone geometry, of the centroid, or even the zone identifier for each sub-zone, as this information can be inferred from the zone order.
