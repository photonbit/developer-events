== Example Use of Model Driven Standards with OGC API - Common

This appendix presents a use of the Model Driven Standards (MDS) approach described in the OGC Guidance for the Development of Model-Driven Standards Discussion Paper (https://docs.ogc.org/dp/23-040.html[OGC 23-040]).

The appendix is added here as input into future code sprints, which are expected to increasingly use MDS as the more editors and developers become familiar with the approach.
